# Meeting Notes - Car System Implementation

## Date: [Current Date]

### Implemented Features
1. Car Registry System
   - Created car data structure with VID (Virtual ID) and UID (Unique ID)
   - Implemented car fetching from JSON repository
   - Added fallback local car data for testing
   - Set up car stats and performance calculations

2. Garage System
   - Created garage UI with grid layout
   - Implemented car card display system
   - Added sorting and filtering capabilities
   - Set up garage data persistence with Firebase

3. Dashboard Navigation
   - Fixed section visibility issues
   - Implemented proper section switching
   - Added smooth transitions between sections
   - Ensured proper initialization of garage on load

### Technical Decisions
1. Car Data Structure
   - VID: Model identifier (e.g., "NEON_COMPACT_2024")
   - UID: Unique instance identifier
   - Stats: Base stats with modification system
   - History: Ownership and modifications tracking

2. UI/UX
   - Grid-based layout for garage
   - Responsive design with auto-fitting columns
   - Neon theme consistent across sections
   - Sticky headers for better navigation

### Learnings
1. Firebase Integration
   - Need to initialize car data before accessing
   - Important to handle undefined states in data fetching
   - User authentication state must be checked before operations

2. Performance Considerations
   - Car data caching improves load times
   - Grid layout performs better than flexbox for large lists
   - Important to handle section visibility properly

3. Bug Fixes
   - Fixed opacity issues with dashboard sections
   - Resolved car modifications array initialization
   - Fixed section visibility toggling

### Next Steps
1. Implement car modification system
2. Add car trading functionality
3. Create shop interface
4. Implement race room system
