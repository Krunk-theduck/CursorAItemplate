## Position & Scroll Fix Testing

### Overview Element Position
1. Initial Position
   - [ ] Refresh page
   - [ ] Verify overview element is in its natural position
   - [ ] Confirm no extra margin/spacing
   - [ ] Check that red line aligns with element position

### Scroll Behavior
1. Smooth Interception
   - [ ] Scroll slowly to red line
   - [ ] Verify scroll interception is consistent (not intermittent)
   - [ ] Check that text reveals after ~3 scroll attempts
   - [ ] Confirm scrolling feels natural and not "jumpy"

### Visual Feedback
1. Debug Line
   - [ ] Confirm red line position matches scroll interception point
   - [ ] Verify smooth transition during scroll
   - [ ] Check line stays aligned with overview element

Please note:
- Whether the overview element position feels natural
- If scroll interception is consistent
- How the accumulation of 3 scrolls feels
- Any remaining positioning or scroll issues
